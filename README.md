This is an AI based project with interactive GUI for on finding a path from source to destination avoiding obstacles using algorithms like:
* (DFS)Depth First Searach
* (BFS)Breadth First Search

Languages Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

We can create walls, change source and destination point and check whether a path is there or not for mars rover to reach the destination from the source.

Future Scopes: 
> Add more efficient algorithms to find the path. 
> Add more maze creation algorithm.
> Make GUI more attractive.
